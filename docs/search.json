It reflects the size and health of a nation’s economy. The above shows quarterly changes in U.S. real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), adjusted for inflation.\nConsumer Sentiment: The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, a measure of how optimistic or pessimistic consumers feel about the economy. Higher values indicate greater confidence, often linked to stronger consumer spending.\nInflation (CPI): The year-over-year percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, a measure of price changes for goods and services. Higher CPI growth means rising inflation; negative values indicate deflation.\nUnemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking work. A falling unemployment rate generally signals labor market strength, while a rising rate may indicate economic weakness.\nTip: Hover over any chart to see exact values and dates.
